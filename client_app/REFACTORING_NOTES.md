# HomeScreen Refactoring Summary

## What was done

The HomeScreen component has been completely refactored and cleaned up to improve maintainability, readability, and follow React best practices.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Extracted Custom Hooks** (`src/hooks/useHomeData.ts`)
- `useEvents`: Manages event loading and filtering
- `useCategories`: Handles category data
- `useUserEvents`: Manages user's joined events
- Moved all API calls and state management logic out of the component

### 2. **Created Reusable Components**
- `EventCard.tsx`: Displays individual event cards
- `FeaturedEventCard.tsx`: Shows featured events with gradient overlay
- `CategoryItem.tsx`: Renders category filter buttons
- `HomeHeader.tsx`: Contains the header with logo and notifications

### 3. **Utility Functions** (`src/utils/dateUtils.ts`)
- `formatDate`: Formats dates for event cards
- `formatDateForFeatured`: Formats dates for featured events
- `isUpcomingEvent`: Checks if an event is upcoming

### 4. **Component Architecture Improvements**
- Reduced HomeScreen from ~623 lines to ~200 lines
- Separated concerns: data fetching, UI rendering, and business logic
- Used composition with section components (`FeaturedSection`, `CategoriesSection`, `EventsSection`)
- Better prop typing and component interfaces

### 5. **Code Organization**
- Moved all styles to respective component files
- Eliminated code duplication
- Improved component testability
- Better separation of concerns

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across the app
3. **Testability**: Easier to unit test individual components and hooks
4. **Readability**: Cleaner, more focused code
5. **Performance**: Better optimization opportunities with smaller components
6. **Developer Experience**: Easier to debug and modify specific features

## File Structure After Refactoring

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── EventCard.tsx          # Individual event card component
│   ├── FeaturedEventCard.tsx  # Featured event card with gradient
│   ├── CategoryItem.tsx       # Category filter button
│   └── HomeHeader.tsx         # Header with logo and notifications
├── hooks/
│   └── useHomeData.ts         # Custom hooks for data management
├── utils/
│   └── dateUtils.ts           # Date formatting utilities
└── screens/
    └── HomeScreen.tsx         # Main screen (now much cleaner)
```

## Usage

The refactored HomeScreen maintains the same functionality but with improved architecture:

```tsx
// The main component is now much simpler and focused
const HomeScreen = () => {
  // Custom hooks handle all data logic
  const { events, loading, loadEvents } = useEvents(activeCategory);
  const { categories } = useCategories();
  const { userEvents } = useUserEvents();
  
  // Clean render with composed sections
  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <HomeHeader />
      <ScrollView>
        <FeaturedSection events={featuredEvents} />
        <CategoriesSection categories={allCategories} />
        <EventsSection events={filteredEvents} />
      </ScrollView>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};
```

## Next Steps

Consider these additional improvements:
1. Add error boundaries for better error handling
2. Implement skeleton loading states
3. Add accessibility features
4. Consider using React Query for better data management
5. Add unit tests for the new components and hooks
